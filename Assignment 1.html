    <h1>AVENGERS</h1>
    <p>The Avengers is a group of our beloved superheroes that exist in not only in the <b>Marvel Cinematic Universe</b> but also our hearts. Originally created by <b>Late Stan Lee</b> in his comics, these heroes have shaped the childhoods of not only our parents' but also ours' when the <b>Russo Brothers</b> adapted it on to the big screen. The original 6 <b>Avengers</b> were <b>Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow</b> and <b>Hawkeye</b>. Let us now learn a little about the origin of these characters prior to Avengers. </p>

        <p><b>Steve Rogers</b> aka <b>Captain America</b> was a would-be U.S. Army enlistee rejected by recruiters because of his small size. He volunteers to receive a top-secret serum and transforms into a “super-soldier.” Dubbed Captain America and clad in a red, white, and blue costume with a matching stars-and-stripes shield, Rogers joins the army.</p>

        <p><b>Tony Stark</b> aka <b>Iron Man</b> was charismatic and eccentric, he was also very proud, but also very altruist and heroic. He did not have a good childhood, and this affected his actions. Stark was very smart, and a very talented inventor. His technology is always very advanced, and Iron Man remains to be his greatest piece of work. His heart was critically injured by shrapnel, and he was captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demanded that Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead built a suit of armor that sustained his heart, becoming Iron Man.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
        <h3><u>THOR</u></h3>
        <img src="Thor.jpg" alt="Thor" height="350px" width="275px">
        <p><b>Thor Odinson</b> aka <b>God of Thunder</b> is a prince and warrior. Thor was short-tempered and strong-willed – two characteristics that his father believeed would prevent him from being a good king. After risking the lives of fellow Asgardians, his father stripped him of his hammer, Mjolnir, and banished him to Earth.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
        <h3><u>HULK</u></h3>

     <li>
        <h3><u>BLACK WIDOW</u></h3>
